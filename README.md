# Panorama-Stitching-with-OpenCV
## Given a pair of images that share some common region, the goal of this project is to “stitch” them and create a panoramic image scene using Python and OpenCV. 

Image stitching or photo stitching is the process of combining multiple photographic images with overlapping fields of view to produce a segmented panorama or high-resolution image.
