# Panorama-Stitching-with-OpenCV
## Given a pair of images that share some common region, the goal of this project is to “stitch” them and create a panoramic image scene using Python and OpenCV. 

Image stitching or photo stitching is the process of combining multiple photographic images with overlapping fields of view to produce a segmented panorama image. It is important to note that both images need to share some common region.

##Specification 
Throughout this article, we go over some of the most famous Computer Vision techniques. These include:
* Keypoint detection
* Local invariant descriptors (SIFT, SURF, etc)
* Feature matching
* Homography estimation using RANSAC
* Perspective warping
